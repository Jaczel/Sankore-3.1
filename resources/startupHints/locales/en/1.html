   <p class="p1">The Open-Sankoré software uses the native players present by default on the computer to interpret audio, video or flash media. However, all formats cannot be played if the computer does not have the necessary codecs installed.</p>
<p class="p1">Codecs are small programs that allow the computer to decode audio and video file formats.</p>
<p class="p1">The players used by Open-Sankoré are :</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Windows Media Player for Windows,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">QuickTime Player for Mac,</li>
  <li class="li1">Phonon (an abstraction of gstreamer ou xine) for Linux.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The following formats are preferred:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Images: .png, .svg, .jpg or .gif</li>
  <li class="li1">Videos: .mp4 or .flv</li>
  <li class="li1">Audio .mp3</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are a few codec packs that enable you to extend the range of multimedia formats supported by the reader used by Open-Sankoré.</p>
<p class="p1">Be careful however when you install them, particularly with free packs that are supposed to contain codecs of several companies. Some of these packs can create problems or instabilities on your operating system.</p>
<p class="p1">Please refer to the documentation of your operating system and to the online support forum.</p>
